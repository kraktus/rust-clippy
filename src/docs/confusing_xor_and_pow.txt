### What it does
Warns for a Bitwise XOR operator being probably confused as a powering. It will not trigger if any of the numbers are not in decimal.
### Why is this bad?
	It's most probably a typo and may lead to unexpected behaviours.
### Example
```
let x = 3_i32 ^ 4_i32;
```
Use instead:
```
let x = 3_i32.pow(4);
```
